## Description
This Horiseon project was created so I could edit the company's code they provided to me. They wanted their code to be edited so their site follows accessibility standards and makes thier site optimized for search engines.

### Deeper Dive
Two of the key changes I made to the index.html in order to improve the code was include alt attributes for all of their images. This way if the images won't load on a user's device there is descriptive text that will be provided in the images's place. This way user's know what should be shown. The second change was to incorporate more HTML elements inplace of using div elements with class names for everything (ex: ```<div class="footer">...</div>``` replaced with: ```<footer>...</footer>```). By making this change, it helped me better organize the css file too in terms of renaming and condensing selectors.

For the style.css, I renamed css selectors to better simplify and make the names more logical for the content (ex:``` .header h1{...}``` replaced with: ```h1{...}```). I also have css selectors organized according to when they appear in the HTML (body -> header content -> main content -> footer content). By doing this it helps with finding content you wish to change faster and easier.
